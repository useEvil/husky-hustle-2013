============

Fundraising website for Managing Registrants, Sponsors and Donations.  Built using Python's Django Framework.  I did this as a volunteer 
for Daughters Elementary School over a one month period.  It has a lot of basic features and third-party integration.  The site allows 
Parents to manage Sponsors and Donations.  Parents can view the list of Donations by Child and send Email Reminders for Sponsors to make 
payments.  A Printable Donation Sheet is available for record keeping or submitting to the School.  Visitors can also make donations if 
they know the Child's Identifier or Donation Link, which can be posted to Facebook or Twitter.  A Photo Gallery is available which integrates 
with Picasa.  There is a simple Blog (with RSS Feed) to post updates.  A simple Contact Us form.  Goole Calendar has been integrated to 
pull event dates.  There is a simple Message of the Week option.  There is also a rising Thermometer so visitors can keep track of the 
progress of the Fundraiser.  Results are calculated and graphed so users and admins can visually see how the Fundraiser is doing.

The Django admin interface allows administers to manage all the data collected through the site.
